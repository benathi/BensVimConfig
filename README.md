MyVimrc
=======

My configuration for vim. I collect this over the last few years of using vim from various online sources.

This includes

1. autotab
2. tab lock like emacs
3. latex configs

Instructions
Note: make sure to backup your ~/.vimrc and ~/.vim if you might need to revert to your configs.

  1. cd into the directory MyVimConfigs
  2. 
    cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc  
  3. cp -r .vim ~/

This configuration works very well for most languages except python. 
TODO
  - need to convert tab to space tab
