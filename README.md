MyVimrc
=======

My configuration for vim. I collect this over the last few years of using vim from various online sources. This includes tab lock like emacs, latex configs, shortcuts for c++ compile + run.

Note: make sure to backup your ~/.vimrc and ~/.vim if you might want to revert to your original configs.

    git clone https://github.com/benathi/BensVimConfig
    cd BensVimConfig
    cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc  
    cp -r .vim ~/
